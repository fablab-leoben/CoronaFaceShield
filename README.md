# CoronaFaceShield
Collection of face shields for personal protection.

FaceSchieldV1.stl is a remake of the face shield of Erik Cederberg's faceshield available at https://github.com/Cederb/Faceshield.nu. The faceshield was redrawn and thereby the brow enlarged to provide more space between the forehead and the shield. This was necessary since guys with glasses have problems with the small room between shield and nose
